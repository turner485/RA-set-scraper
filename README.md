# RetroAchievements Game Collector

RetroAchievements Game Collector is a Windows desktop application that automates searching, downloading, and organizing the most recent retail game ROMs for a wide range of classic gaming consoles. It uses the RetroAchievements API to fetch the latest achievement set claims and retrieves matching ROMs from trusted sources like Myrient and Archive.org.

## How It Works (Technical Overview)

#### Configuration
- Loads user settings (API key, download path) from a `.env` file or the Settings tab.
- Uses `config.py` for configuration management.

#### Fetching Recent Games
- Uses `api_client.py` to call the RetroAchievements API and retrieve the most recent achievement set claims.

#### Game Processing
- Filters games by user-selected consoles.
- Cleans and normalizes game titles for accurate Game searching (`utils/text_utils.py`).

#### Game Source Lookup
- Maps each console to one or more Game source URLs (`core/rom_sources.py`).
- Searches for matching Game files on Myrient and Archive.org using HTML parsing.

#### Game Downloading
- Downloads Games to the specified directory, organized by console.
- Shows download progress and handles errors gracefully (`collector_worker.py`, `utils/file_utils.py`).

### Game Search Tab
- Allows manual searching and downloading of Games by console and name (`gui/rom_search/`).
- Supports regex search, source listing, and per-Game download progress.

### GUI
- Main window with tabs for recent set collection, Game search, and settings (`gui/main_window.py`).
- Styled with custom themes (`gui/styles.py`).

### Troubleshooting
- If Windows Defender or your antivirus flags the `.exe`, this is a common false positive for new or unsigned applications.
- If you see errors about missing DLLs, ensure you extracted all files from the release zip.
- If you have issues, please open an issue on GitHub or contact the author.
