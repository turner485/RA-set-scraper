### Troubleshooting
- If Windows Defender or your antivirus flags the `.exe`, this is a common false positive for new or unsigned applications.
- If you see errors about missing DLLs, ensure you extracted all files from the release zip.
- If you have issues, please open an issue on GitHub or contact the author.
